This script will be used by the staff to build and run your
submission after you have submitted it through the LMS.
It is provided so that you can check that you have followed our
instructions as to which java files to modify/write/submit.
However, you should develop your project solution in Eclipse,
not use this script for development.

To check that your submission will build and run :

+ Extract the contents of this 'build.zip' file into a folder (if you have not done so already).
+ Copy a clean (unchanged) version of 'Part A.zip' into the same folder.
+ Copy your submission zip file called 'submission.zip' into the same folder.
+ Run the build.bat script in that folder.
